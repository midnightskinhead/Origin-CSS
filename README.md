Origin CSS
====

Origin CSS is a collection of CSS styles I'm using as base when I start a new project.

It comes with:

 * reset.css : The traditional CSS reset (Based on Eric Meyer's reset)
 * font.css : Font-face usage example
 * layout.css : Body styles and a grid system
 * block : Blocks styles (or boxes, or modules, whatever you call them)
 * link : Links
 * form : Forms, forms elements and a form-centric grid system
 * button : Buttons and button-like links
 * table : Tables
 * message : Messages (Warning, Error, Information, etc.)

You can find a sample usage of these styles in the sample.html demo file.
